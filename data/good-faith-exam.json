{
“question”: “What if I don’t pass the exam?”,
“answer”: “If any contraindications are identified, our medical provider will discuss alternative options or refer you to your primary care physician for further evaluation.”
},
{
“question”: “Can I complete the exam on the same day as my IV treatment?”,
“answer”: “Yes! We can often schedule your GFE and first IV session back-to-back for maximum convenience.”
},
{
“question”: “Is my medical information secure?”,
“answer”: “Absolutely. We use HIPAA-compliant telehealth platforms and maintain strict confidentiality of all medical records.”
},
{
“question”: “What happens after 12 months?”,
“answer”: “You’ll need to complete a brief renewal assessment, which is typically even shorter than the initial exam.”
},
{
“question”: “Can I get IV therapy without the exam?”,
“answer”: “No, Arizona law requires medical clearance for all IV therapy patients. This ensures your safety and our compliance with state regulations.”
